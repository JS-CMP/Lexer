# [JS-CMP Lexer](https://github.com/JS-CMP/Lexer)

## Description

**JS-CMP Lexer** is a core component of the JS-CMP transpiler, responsible for breaking down JavaScript code into tokens for further processing. The lexer handles syntax analysis and tokenization, enabling accurate conversion of JavaScript syntax to C++ representations. It supports ECMAScript 5 features and is written in C++ .
